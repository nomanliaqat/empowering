            Today more than ever, educators recognize benefits of
            social-emotional learning (SEL) initiatives. However, most available
            programs are difficult to implement and lack focus on
            “entrepreneurial spirit.” We define having an entrepreneurial spirit
            as living with passion and purpose, following your dreams, and
            refusing to accept defeat. This is something that can benefit all
            youth as they grow and mature.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Key Pillars for developing an entrepreneurial spirit provide a
            new perspective on SEL curricula. We have expanded on the
            Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning
            competencies to create a SEL program based on nine foundational
            pillars. These pillars form a roadmap young people everywhere can
            use to explore themselves, gain self-confidence, and develop their
            entrepreneurial spirit.
            <br />
            These pillars can also help our youth navigate challenges in school,
            develop a career plan, and step out into adulthood.

            Empowering Confident Youth (ECY) was developed based on the belief
            that young people with a passion and enthusiasm for life will be the
            exceptional community members, amazing parents, and capable leaders
            needed to face an uncertain future.
          </p>

          <p>
            This standalone program has been compiled into 11 one-hour workshops
            that can easily be taught once a week. They are designed for
            educators in classroom settings and community settings either in
            person or online.
